    "# Module 1 Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll review all of the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe all required aspects of the final project for Module 1\n",
    "* Describe all required deliverables\n",
    "* Describe what constitutes a successful project\n",
    "* Describe what the experience of the project review should be like\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You've made it all the way through the first module of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!\n",
    "\n",
    "![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1/master/awesome.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "All that remains in Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! You should expect this project to take between 20 and 25 hours of solid, focused effort. If you're done way quicker, go back and dig in deeper or try some of the optional \"level up\" suggestions. If you're worried that you're going to get to 30 hrs and still not even have the data imported, reach out to an instructor in Slack ASAP to get some help!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.\n",
    "Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You may scrape or make API calls to get additional data, but included in the repository (in the folder `zippedData`) is some movie-related data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box Office Mojo\n",
    "- IMDB\n",
    "- Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "- TheMovieDB.org\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A well documented **Master Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it.  Think of this as an executive summary document that summarizes your findings and contains narration. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.  \n",
    "2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.\n",
    "3. A short **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Master Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organization/Code Cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebooks should include a section that claearly outlines the questions you will be answering and the purpose of the project.\n",
    "* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code should be commented where appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "  >Be sure to utilize the markdown cells to provide headings for sections and include a logocal sequence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation\n",
    "* To make sure your notebook is clean you may want to use functions imported from external .py files.\n",
    "\n",
    "_we've never really gotten into the difference between python files and whatever jupyter does\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook is written for technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.\n",
    "* The notebook should contain a conclusion section where you reflect back on the questions you posed and provide a recommendation for the stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizations & EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your project contains at least __4 meaningful data visualizations__, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate).  There should also be some markdown text explaining the key take-aways of your visualization.  \n",
    "* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook.\n",
    "    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   \n",
    "* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Technical Presentation Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "Another deliverable should be a Keynote, PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation delivered as a pdf file in your repository with the file name of `presentation.pdf` detailing the results of your project.  Your target audience is non-technical people interested in using your findings to make decisions for creating movies.  You may use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iS5kCJVBiieuUEokWLOSjuAxlz9oX-tPV2xr0i9RYdA/edit?usp=sharing) as guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contain between 5 - 10 professional-quality slides.  \n",
    "    * **Level Up**: The slides should use visualizations (both ones you have created and any other stock images or \"infographic\" type material) whenever possible, and avoid walls of text.\n",
    "* Take no more than __5 minutes__ to present.   \n",
    "* Avoid technical jargon and explain the results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.  \n",
    "* Clearly articulate the goal of the project and guiding questions.\n",
    "* Clearly relate your results back to the organizational problem and provide __actionable recommendations__. \n",
    "\n",
    "___\"It's good practice to also include it in a pdf\"\n",
    "\n",
    "___May want to include \"next steps\" or \"limitations\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">From Murat: \"five minutes in presentation language is called 'a lightning talk'\". \n",
    "\n",
    "___\"If you write something in your slides you need to talk about it; don't include information in your slides that you're not going to touch.\"\n",

    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start by reviewing this document. If you have any questions, please ask them in Slack ASAP so (a) we can answer the questions and (b) so we can update this repository to make it clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Project Pitch- Monday\n",
    "\n",
    "You will meet with your instructors on Monday to \"pitch\" your project idea.  Be prepared to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What datasets do you plan to use?\n",
    "- What questions will you be answering with your visualizations?\n",
    "- What ways might you visualize this data to address the questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "__I assume it's okay to deviate significantly from our project pitch? \n",
    ">\"We would like to understand the movie data\" is not a statement in data science.  Man I'm really going to miss Murat. \n",
    ">\"We looked at a large data set\" is not meaningful.  \n",
    ">\"There is a large impact in action movies on 12-19\" requires you to define what is meant by \"large impact\", why 12-19 was chosen. \n",

    "   - Have you done any data-type conversion?\n",
    "      - ex: numerical data incorrectly 'typed' as strings.\n",
    "    - Does your data contain any outliers or non-sensical values?\n",
    "- Modeling/Visualization\n",
    "   - What visualizations have you already made/planning to make?\n",
    "   - What messages are these visualizations trying to convey?\n",
    "   - Are these visualizations effective at communicating the solution to your business question/enhancing your story?\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The end of module projects and project reviews are a critical part of the program. They give you a chance to both bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects and to practice key \"business judgement\" and communication skills that you otherwise might not get as much practice with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projects are serious and important. They are not graded, but they can be passed and they can be failed. Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is your first project. We don't expect you to remember all of the terms or to get all of the answers right. If in doubt, be honest. If you don't know something, say so. If you can't remember it, just say so. It's very unusual for someone to complete a project review without being asked a question they're unsure of, we know you might be nervous which may affect your performance. Just be as honest, precise and focused as you can be, and you'll do great!\n"
